/**
 * Draws this Node via the given SpriteBatch.

 * This method only worries about drawing the current node.  It does not
 * attempt to render the children.
 *
 * This is the method that you should override to implement your custom
 * drawing code.  You are welcome to use any OpenGL commands that you wish.
 * You can even skip use of the SpriteBatch.  However, if you do so, you
 * must flush the SpriteBatch by calling end() at the start of the method.
 * in addition, you should remember to call begin() at the start of the
 * method.
 *
 * This method provides the correct transformation matrix and tint color.
 * You do not need to worry about whether the node uses relative color.
 * This method is called by render() and these values are guaranteed to be
 * correct.  In addition, this method does not need to check for visibility,
 * as it is guaranteed to only be called when the node is visible.
 *
 * @param batch     The SpriteBatch to draw with.
 * @param matrix    The global transformation matrix.
 * @param tint      The tint to blend with the Node color.
