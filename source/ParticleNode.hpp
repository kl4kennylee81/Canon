     * drawing code.  You are welcome to use any OpenGL commands that you wish.
     * You can even skip use of the SpriteBatch.  However, if you do so, you
     * must flush the SpriteBatch by calling end() at the start of the method.
     * in addition, you should remember to call begin() at the start of the
     * method.

     * This method provides the correct transformation matrix and tint color.
     * You do not need to worry about whether the node uses relative color.
     * This method is called by render() and these values are guaranteed to be
     * correct.  In addition, this method does not need to check for visibility,
     * as it is guaranteed to only be called when the node is visible.
     *
     * @param batch     The SpriteBatch to draw with.
     * @param transform The global transformation matrix.
     * @param tint      The tint to blend with the Node color.
